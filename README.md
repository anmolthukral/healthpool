# HealthPool

A small cross-platform React app (Vite) that uses browser geolocation and the Overpass API to list nearby hospitals with a simple polished UI.

How to run:

1. cd healthpool
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Notes:

- Uses Overpass API (OpenStreetMap) so no API key is required. For heavy usage consider hosting your own Overpass instance or add rate-limiting.
- Map preview is placeholder — you can wire up a map (Leaflet, Mapbox GL) using the returned lat/lon values.
