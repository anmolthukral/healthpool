Notes on Lynx (ByteDance) support

- Lynx is a cross-platform technology internally used by ByteDance. Their public tooling varies by region and setup.
- The example in this folder is plain HTML/JS that demonstrates the data flow (geolocation + Overpass). To integrate into an actual Lynx project, translate the JS into Lynx page/component lifecycle and use the Lynx CLI to package.
- If you have an internal Lynx CLI or template, send me the project format and I can adapt the files into the precise layout.
