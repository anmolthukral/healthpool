HealthPool (Lynx)

This folder contains a minimal scaffold for a Lynx-based HealthPool app. Lynx is ByteDance's cross-platform framework; their internal CLI and packaging vary by environment. This scaffold shows how to structure pages and use the browser geolocation API and Overpass API to fetch nearby hospitals.

Note: To fully build/run a Lynx app you will need the Lynx SDK/CLI used in your environment. The files here are a starting point and may require adaptation.
